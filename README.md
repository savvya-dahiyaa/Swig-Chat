# Swig-Chat
Swig-Chat is an intelligent customer support chatbot designed to enhance user experience on Swiggy by providing real-time order assistance, empathetic responses, and proactive issue resolution.
Swig-Chat aims to replicate a real-world food delivery support system by combining structured order data with realistic customer scenarios.
It intelligently understands user queries, identifies the order context, and responds using tone-based messages, whether helpful, apologetic, or delightful depending on the situation. 
It uses
a detailed order dataset with real-life fields (order ID, status, ETA, payment method, delay reasons, complaints, Instamart items, etc.)
and a scenario dataset with 70+ situations (angry user, missing item, delays, refunds, cancellations, Instamart issues, etc.)
Based on the user’s message and emotion, the chatbot picks the correct scenario and generates empathetic, contextual, and brand-aligned responses.
